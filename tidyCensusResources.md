Kyle Walker has a copy of the pre-release of his forthcoming book https://walker-data.com/census-r/ -

https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/? Getting familiar with this is where we will be starting this week as we will be needing to access ACS census data as one of the sources for our Tableau Dashboards.
Last year in March, Kyle Walker hosted a workshop on the use of tidyCensus. I would like each of you to work through the March 4 and March 11 workshop using your local RStudio. Resources are as follows:
